        <![CDATA[
        .NET doesn't distinguish between static/const/instance members based on casing. Casing is only
        used to signify private vs non-private per official guidelines. This actually loads different 
        purposes to member casing on .NET and confuses the programmer.
        
        An example would be that if we access a member with CapitalCasing it can mean either we're 
        accessing a public member or a private static/const which would confuse the programmer about
        accessibility. Instead use casing only to signify accessibility: camelCase for private, CapitalCase
        for internal/protected/public member types.
